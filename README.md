# PlaceWithEase
This is an interactive Web-based application for the interaction between seniors ans juniors of a particular instution where seniors can communicate with juniors, resolve their doubts and share placement related content like study resources, preparation strategies, interview tips, etc.
## Purpose
In the era of online classes, students often face difficulty in interacting with their fellow classmates and seniors. When it comes to placement preparation, the best people who can help are seniors but interaction between junior and seniors is not an easy task especially when online. There are various platforms where interaction can take place but they are not especially designed for this purpose but what if there is a platform exclusively designed for this purpose? Things would be much easier and efficient. So this is a web based application exclusively designed for the interaction between senior and juniors of the particular institution.
